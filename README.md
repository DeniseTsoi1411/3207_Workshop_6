# 3207_Workshop_6
### Project information
The project focuses on fish activity depending on ocean acidification. This is a collaborative work with Angelene Sun and myself.

The file used is called: "OA_activitydat_20190302_BIOL3207.csv" and analysis was done during early September. We looked at this dataset to find discrepencies in the original hypothesise that was established by the authors.

The data file is a CSV file with 9 columns. While 3 of these are useless (...1, loc, comment) in this analysis, the rest gives information on fish activity depending on the acidification of the water. All 6 species underwent either a control or CO2 treatment, and their "sl" and "activity" were measured. 
### General workflow
After establishing the workpath, data wrangling was done to clean unnecessary data. The data was also summarised based on numerical information of different treatments and species.
